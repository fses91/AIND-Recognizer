    "The overall goal of this project is to build a word recognizer for American Sign Language video sequences, demonstrating the power of probabalistic models.  In particular, this project employs  [hidden Markov models (HMM's)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) to analyze a series of measurements taken from videos of American Sign Language (ASL) collected for research (see the [RWTH-BOSTON-104 Database](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/database-rwth-boston-104.php)).  In this video, the right-hand x and y locations are plotted as the speaker signs the sentence.\n",

    "The raw data, train, and test sets are pre-defined.  You will derive a variety of feature sets (explored in Part 1), as well as implement three different model selection criterion to determine the optimal number of hidden states for each word model (explored in Part 2). Finally, in Part 3 you will implement the recognizer and compare the effects the different combinations of feature sets and model selection criteria.  \n",

For example, we could normalize each speaker's range of motion with grouped statistics using [Pandas stats](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#api-dataframe-stats) functions and [pandas groupby](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html).

Because if we go to the videos (http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/database/rwth-boston-104/overview/), we can see that for some signs the distance is high in the beginning and than descreases or vice versa.

As a simple starting example, we train a single word using Gaussian hidden Markov models (HMM).   By using the `fit` method during training, the [Baum-Welch Expectation-Maximization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Welch_algorithm) (EM) algorithm is invoked iteratively to find the best estimate for the model *for the number of hidden states specified* from a group of sample seequences. For this example, we *assume* the correct number of hidden states is 3, but that is just a guess.  How do we know what the \"best\" number of states for training is?  We will need to find some model selection technique to choose the best parameter."

    "##### Cross-validation folds\n",
    "If we simply score the model with the Log Likelihood calculated from the feature sequences it has been trained on, we should expect that more complex models will have higher likelihoods. However, that doesn't tell us which would have a better likelihood score on unseen data.  The model will likely be overfit as complexity is added.  To estimate which topology model is better using only the training data, we can compare scores using cross-validation.  One technique for cross-validation is to break the training set into \"folds\" and rotate which fold is left out of training.  The \"left out\" fold scored.  This gives us a proxy method of finding the best model to use on \"unseen data\". In the following example, a set of word sequences is broken into three folds using the [scikit-learn Kfold](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html) class object. When you implement `SelectorCV`, you will use this technique."

    "Scoring model topologies with **BIC** balances fit and complexity within the training set for each word.  In the BIC equation, a penalty term penalizes complexity to avoid overfitting, so that it is not necessary to also use cross-validation in the selection process.  There are a number of references on the internet for this criterion.  These [slides](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02433/doc/ch6_slides.pdf) include a formula you may find helpful for your implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of scoring model topologies with **DIC** over BIC are presented by Alain Biem in this [reference](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.58.6208&rep=rep1&type=pdf) (also found [here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ed3d/7c4a5f607201f3848d4c02dd9ba17c791fc2.pdf)).  DIC scores the discriminant ability of a training set for one word against competing words.  Instead of a penalty term for complexity, it provides a penalty if model liklihoods for non-matching words are too similar to model likelihoods for the correct word in the word set."

For example if we want to calculate the probability of 'YESTERDAY'  it would be bad if the probability of 'WRITE' is very close to the probabilty of 'YESTERDAY'. So DIC tries to find hyperparameters where the distance in probabilty output of samples belonging to that class and not belonging to that class is very high."

    "We've squeezed just about as much as we can out of the model and still only get about 50% of the words right! Surely we can do better than that.  Probability to the rescue again in the form of [statistical language models (SLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model).  The basic idea is that each word has some probability of occurrence within the set, and some probability that it is adjacent to specific other words. We can use that additional information to make better choices.\n",
